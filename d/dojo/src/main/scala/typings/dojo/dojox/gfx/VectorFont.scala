/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/gfx.VectorFont.html
  *
  * An implementation of the SVG Font 1.1 spec, using dojox/gfx.
  *
  * Basic interface:
  *
  * var f = new gfx.Font(url|string);
  * surface||group.createVectorText(text)
  * .setFill(fill)
  * .setStroke(stroke)
  * .setFont(fontStyleObject);
  * The arguments passed to createVectorText are the same as you would
  * pass to surface||group.createText; the difference is that this
  * is entirely renderer-agnostic, and the return value is a subclass
  * of dojox/gfx.Group.
  *
  * Note also that the "defaultText" object is slightly different:
  * { type:"vectortext", x:0, y:0, width:null, height: null,
  * text: "", align: "start", decoration: "none" }
  *
  * ...as well as the "defaultVectorFont" object:
  * { type:"vectorfont", size:"10pt" }
  *
  * The reason for this should be obvious: most of the style for the font is defined
  * by the font object itself.
  *
  * Note that this will only render IF and WHEN you set the font.
  *
  * @param url An url pointing to the SVG Font definition.

  /**
    * based on the passed parameters, draw the given text using paths
    * defined by this font.
    * The main method of a VectorFont, draw() will take a text fragment
    * and render it in a set of groups and paths based on the parameters
    * passed.
    *
    * The basics of drawing text are simple enough: pass it your text as
    * part of the textArgs object, pass size and family info as part of
    * the fontArgs object, pass at least a color as the fillArgs object,
    * and if you are looking to create an outline, pass the strokeArgs
    * object as well. fillArgs and strokeArgs are the same as any other
    * gfx fill and stroke arguments; they are simply applied to any path
    * object generated by this method.
    *
    * Resulting GFX structure
    * The result of this function is a set of gfx objects in the following structure:
    *
    * gfx.Group           //      the parent group generated by this function
    * +   gfx.Group[]     //      a group generated for each line of text
    *     +   gfx.Path[]  //      each glyph/character in the text
    * Scaling transformations (i.e. making the generated text the correct size)
    * are always applied to the parent Group that is generated (i.e. the top
    * node in the above example).  In theory, if you are looking to do any kind
    * of other transformations (such as a translation), you should apply it to
    * the group reference you pass to this method.  If you find that you need
    * to apply transformations to the group that is returned by this method,
    * you will need to reapply the scaling transformation as the last transform,
    * like so:
    *
    * textGroup.setTransform(new matrix.Matrix2D([
    *     matrix.translate({ dx: dx, dy: dy }),
    *     textGroup.getTransform()
    * ]));
    * In general, this should never be necessary unless you are doing advanced
    * placement of your text.
    *
    * Advanced Layout Functionality
    * In addition to straight text fragments, draw() supports a few advanced
    * operations not normally available with vector graphics:
    *
    * Flow operations (i.e. wrap to a given width)
    * Fitting operations (i.e. find a best fit to a given rectangle)
    * To enable either, pass a fitting property along with the textArgs object.
    * The possible values are contained in the dojox/gfx.vectorFontFitting enum
    * (NONE, FLOW, FIT).
    *
    * Flow fitting
    * Flow fitting requires both a passed size (in the fontArgs object) and a
    * width (passed with the textArgs object).  draw() will attempt to split the
    * passed text up into lines, at the closest whitespace according to the
    * passed width.  If a width is missing, it will revert to NONE.
    *
    * Best fit fitting
    * Doing a "best fit" means taking the passed text, and finding the largest
    * size and line breaks so that it is the closest fit possible.  With best
    * fit, any size arguments are ignored; if a height is missing, it will revert
    * to NONE.
    *
    * Other notes
    * a11y
    * Since the results of this method are rendering using pure paths (think
    * "convert to outlines" in Adobe Illustrator), any text rendered by this
    * code is NOT considered a11y-friendly.  If a11y is a requirement, we
    * suggest using other, more a11y-friendly methods.
    *
    * Font sources
    * Always make sure that you are legally allowed to use any fonts that you
    * convert to SVG format; we claim no responsibility for any licensing
    * infractions that may be caused by the use of this code.
