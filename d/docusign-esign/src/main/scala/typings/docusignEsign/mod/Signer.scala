    * a recipient token to launch a signing session.
    *
    * If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated

    * It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application.

    *
    * If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing
    * process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
