/**
  * An `Agent` is the representation of a client's `Connection` state on the
  * server. If the `Connection` was created through `backend.connect` (i.e. the
  * client is running in the same Node process as the server), then the `Agent`
  * associated with a `Connection` can be accessed through `connection.agent`.
  *
  * The `Agent` will be made available in all middleware requests. The
  * `agent.custom` field is an object that can be used for storing arbitrary
  * information for use in middleware.
  *
