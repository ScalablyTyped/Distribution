/**
 * The JS Buy SDK is a lightweight library that allows you to build ecommerce into any website.
 * It is based on Shopify’s API and provides the ability to retrieve products and collections from your shop,
 * add products to a cart, and checkout.
 * It can render data on the client side or server. This will allow you to add ecommerce functionality to any
 * website or javascript application. This is helpful if you already have a website and need to add ecommerce
 * or only need a simple buy button on your site.
