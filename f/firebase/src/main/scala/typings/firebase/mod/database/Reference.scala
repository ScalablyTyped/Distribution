    * Atomically modify the data at this location. Unlike a normal `set()`, which
    * just overwrites the data regardless of its previous value, `transaction()` is
    * used to modify the existing value to a new value, ensuring there are no
    * conflicts with other clients writing to the same location at the same time.
    *
    * To accomplish this, you pass `transaction()` an update function which is used
    * to transform the current value into a new value. If another client writes to
    * the location before your new value is successfully written, your update
    * function will be called again with the new current value, and the write will
    * be retried. This will happen repeatedly until your write succeeds without
    * conflict or you abort the transaction by not returning a value from your
    * update function.
    *
    * Note: Modifying data with `set()` will cancel any pending transactions at
    * that location, so extreme care should be taken if mixing `set()` and
    * `transaction()` to update the same data.
    *
    * Note: When using transactions with Security and Firebase Rules in place, be
    * aware that a client needs `.read` access in addition to `.write` access in
    * order to perform a transaction. This is because the client-side nature of
    * transactions requires the client to read the data in order to transactionally
    * update it.
    *
    * @example
    * ```javascript
    * // Increment Ada's rank by 1.
    * var adaRankRef = firebase.database().ref('users/ada/rank');

    *   // If users/ada/rank has never been set, currentRank will be `null`.
    *   return currentRank + 1;
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * @example
    * ```javascript
    * // Try to create a user for ada, but only if the user id 'ada' isn't
    * // already taken
    * var adaRef = firebase.database().ref('users/ada');

    *   a JavaScript object). If `undefined` is returned (i.e. you return with no
    *   arguments) the transaction will be aborted and the data at this location
    *   will not be modified.
    * @param onComplete A callback
    *   function that will be called when the transaction completes. The callback
    *   is passed three arguments: a possibly-null `Error`, a `boolean` indicating
    *   whether the transaction was committed, and a `DataSnapshot` indicating the
    *   final result. If the transaction failed abnormally, the first argument will
    *   be an `Error` object indicating the failure cause. If the transaction
    *   finished normally, but no data was committed because no data was returned
    *   from `transactionUpdate`, then second argument will be false. If the

    *   will be true. Regardless, the third argument will be a `DataSnapshot`
    *   containing the resulting data in this location.
    * @param applyLocally By default, events are raised each time the
    *   transaction update function runs. So if it is run multiple times, you may
