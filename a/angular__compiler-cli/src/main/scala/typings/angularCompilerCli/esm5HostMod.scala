      * This can happen if ES2015 class output contain auto-generated constructors due to class

      * A constructor function may have been "synthesized" by TypeScript during JavaScript emit,
      * in the case no user-defined constructor exists and e.g. property initializers are used.
      * Those initializers need to be emitted into a constructor in JavaScript, so the TypeScript
      * compiler generates a synthetic constructor.
      *
      * We need to identify such constructors as ngcc needs to be able to tell if a class did
      * originally have a constructor in the TypeScript source. For ES5, we can not tell an
      * empty constructor apart from a synthesized constructor, but fortunately that does not
      * matter for the code generated by ngtsc.
      *
      * When a class has a superclass however, a synthesized constructor must not be considered
      * as a user-defined constructor as that prevents a base factory call from being created by
      * ngtsc, resulting in a factory function that does not inject the dependencies of the
      * superclass. Hence, we identify a default synthesized super call in the constructor body,
      * according to the structure that TypeScript's ES2015 to ES5 transformer generates in
      * https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v3.2.2/src/compiler/transformers/es2015.ts#L1082-L1098
      *
      * Additionally, we handle synthetic delegate constructors that are emitted when TypeScript
      * downlevel's ES2015 synthetically generated to ES5. These vary slightly from the default
      * structure mentioned above because the ES2015 output uses a spread operator, for delegating
      * to the parent constructor, that is preserved through a TypeScript helper in ES5. e.g.
      *
      * ```
      * return _super.apply(this, tslib.__spread(arguments)) || this;
      * ```
      *
      * or, since TypeScript 4.2 it would be
      *
      * ```
      * return _super.apply(this, tslib.__spreadArray([], tslib.__read(arguments))) || this;
      * ```
      *
      * Such constructs can be still considered as synthetic delegate constructors as they are
      * the product of a common TypeScript to ES5 synthetic constructor, just being downleveled
      * to ES5 using `tsc`. See: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38453.
