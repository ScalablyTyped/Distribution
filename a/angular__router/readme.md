/**
 * This component is used internally within the router to be a placeholder when an empty
 * router-outlet is needed. For example, with a config such as:
 *
 * `{path: 'parent', outlet: 'nav', children: [...]}`
 *
 * In order to render, there needs to be a component on this config, which will default
 * to this `EmptyOutletComponent`.
