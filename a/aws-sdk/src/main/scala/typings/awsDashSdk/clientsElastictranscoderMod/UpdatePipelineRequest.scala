    * The optional ContentConfig object specifies information about the Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files and playlists: which bucket to use, which users you want to have access to the files, the type of access you want users to have, and the storage class that you want to assign to the files. If you specify values for ContentConfig, you must also specify values for ThumbnailConfig. If you specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig, omit the OutputBucket object.    Bucket: The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files and playlists.    Permissions (Optional): The Permissions object specifies which users you want to have access to transcoded files and the type of access you want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum of 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.    Grantee Type: Specify the type of value that appears in the Grantee object:    Canonical: The value in the Grantee object is either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. For more information about canonical user IDs, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about using CloudFront origin access identities to require that users use CloudFront URLs instead of Amazon S3 URLs, see Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content.  A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.     Email: The value in the Grantee object is the registered email address of an AWS account.    Group: The value in the Grantee object is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery.      Grantee: The AWS user or group that you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists. To identify the user or group, you can specify the canonical user ID for an AWS account, an origin access identity for a CloudFront distribution, the registered email address of an AWS account, or a predefined Amazon S3 group     Access: The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that you specified in Grantee. Permissions are granted on the files that Elastic Transcoder adds to the bucket, including playlists and video files. Valid values include:     READ: The grantee can read the objects and metadata for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    READ_ACP: The grantee can read the object ACL for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     WRITE_ACP: The grantee can write the ACL for the objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    FULL_CONTROL: The grantee has READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions for the objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.      StorageClass: The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.
