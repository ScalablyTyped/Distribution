    * The metric about which you are receiving information. Valid values are listed below, along with the most useful statistics to include in your request.     ClientTLSNegotiationErrorCount  - The number of TLS connections initiated by the client that did not establish a session with the load balancer. Possible causes include a mismatch of ciphers or protocols.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.     HealthyHostCount  - The number of target instances that are considered healthy.  Statistics: The most useful statistic are Average, Minimum, and Maximum.     UnhealthyHostCount  - The number of target instances that are considered unhealthy.  Statistics: The most useful statistic are Average, Minimum, and Maximum.     HTTPCode_LB_4XX_Count  - The number of HTTP 4XX client error codes that originate from the load balancer. Client errors are generated when requests are malformed or incomplete. These requests have not been received by the target instance. This count does not include any response codes generated by the target instances.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.     HTTPCode_LB_5XX_Count  - The number of HTTP 5XX server error codes that originate from the load balancer. This count does not include any response codes generated by the target instances.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.     HTTPCode_Instance_2XX_Count  - The number of HTTP response codes generated by the target instances. This does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.     HTTPCode_Instance_3XX_Count  - The number of HTTP response codes generated by the target instances. This does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.   Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.     HTTPCode_Instance_4XX_Count  - The number of HTTP response codes generated by the target instances. This does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.     HTTPCode_Instance_5XX_Count  - The number of HTTP response codes generated by the target instances. This does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.     InstanceResponseTime  - The time elapsed, in seconds, after the request leaves the load balancer until a response from the target instance is received.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Average.     RejectedConnectionCount  - The number of connections that were rejected because the load balancer had reached its maximum number of connections.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.     RequestCount  - The number of requests processed over IPv4. This count includes only the requests with a response generated by a target instance of the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.
