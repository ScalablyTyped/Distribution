If the service is using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The service-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

If you specify the role parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter.

For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

This scheduler strategy is required if the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types.    DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.
