    * Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system. Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you to restore a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system. For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems with the following configuration:   a Persistent deployment type   is not linked to an Amazon S3 data respository.   For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-backups.html.

If a backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a backup with the specified client request token doesn't exist, CreateBackup does the following:    Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the backup.   By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateBackup operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same. The CreateBackup operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still CREATING.
