DELETE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.    DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is being deleted in the member account.    DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been deleted in the member account.     UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been updated in the member account.    UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is being updated in the member account.    UPDATE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.
