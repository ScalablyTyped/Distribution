/**
  * The main task of this service is to close an office document frame embedded in an application running in another process correctly.
  *
  * The usual usage of this service is to create it, initialize with document frame, and to dispose the service. While disposing the service will do all
  * the required actions to let the frame be closed using com::sun::star::util::XCloseable::close( true ). Thus in case there is a code that prevents
  * closing of the frame the code automatically becomes the owner of the frame.
  *
  * In addition the code will disconnect the VCL window the frame is based on from the container system window.
