/**
  * is used as an output stream for writing the attributes of a user-defined type back to the database. This interface, used only for custom mapping, is
  * used by the driver, and its methods are never directly invoked by a programmer.
  *
  * When an object of a class implementing interface {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData} is passed as an argument to a SQL statement, the JDBC driver calls
  * com::sun::star::sdbc::SQLData::getSQLType() to determine the kind of SQL datum being passed to the database. ;  The driver then creates an instance of
  * `XSQLOutput` and passes it to the method {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData.writeSQL()} . The method `writeSQL` in turn calls the appropriate
  * `XSQLOutput.writeXXX` methods to write data from the {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData} object to the `XSQLOutput` output stream as the representation
  * of a SQL user-defined type.
