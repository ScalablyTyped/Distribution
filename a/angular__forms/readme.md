 * `novalidate` is used to disable browser's native form validation.

/**
 * @module
 * @description
 * This module is used for handling user input, by defining and building a `FormGroup` that
 * consists of `FormControl` objects, and mapping them onto the DOM. `FormControl`
 * objects can then be used to read information from the form DOM elements.
 *
 * Forms providers are not included in default providers; you must import these providers
