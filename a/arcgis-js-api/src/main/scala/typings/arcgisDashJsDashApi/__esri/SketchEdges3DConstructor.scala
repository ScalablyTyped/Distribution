  * SketchEdges3D is a symbol type that visualizes edges of [3D Object SceneLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-SceneLayer.html), extruded polygons or mesh geometries with a sketched line. It can be used to emphasize the form of 3D objects and to improve the three-dimensional spatial understanding. A sketched line aims to look like a hand-drawn line. In architecture this is useful for visualizing planned urban projects.
