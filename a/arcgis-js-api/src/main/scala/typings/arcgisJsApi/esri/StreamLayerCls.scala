  * The stream layer connects to a stream of data using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket). It connects to a server that emits geographic features continuously. The stream layer is suitable when you would like to map dynamic streams of data that are unbounded and continuous. When a stream layer is added to a map, users are able to see real-time updates pushed out by the server.
