    * Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have `read` access for the repository to use this endpoint.
    *
    * **Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.
    *
    * You can pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to  fetch `diff` and `patch` formats. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.
    *
    * To return only the SHA-1 hash of the commit reference, you can provide the `sha` custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) in the `Accept` header. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.
    *
    * **Signature verification object**
    *
    * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:
    *
    * | Name | Type | Description |
    * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
    * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
    * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
    * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
    * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
    *
    * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
    *
    * | Value | Description |
    * | ----- | ----------- |
    * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
    * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
    * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
    * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
    * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
    * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
    * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
    * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
    * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
    * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
    * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
    * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
    * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |
