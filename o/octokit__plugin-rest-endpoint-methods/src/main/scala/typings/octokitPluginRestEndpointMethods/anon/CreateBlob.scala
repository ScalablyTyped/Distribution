    * Returns an array of references from your Git database that match the supplied name. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`, they will be returned as an array.

    * When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is returned, not just `heads` and `tags`.

    * **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#get-a-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests.
