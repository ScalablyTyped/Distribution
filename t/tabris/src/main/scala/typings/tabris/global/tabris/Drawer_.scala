/**
  * A drawer that can be swiped in from the left edge of the screen. There's only a single instance that
  * can be accessed via `tabris.drawer`. The drawer is locked by default. To use it in an application,
  * set the property `enabled` to `true`. The drawer can contain any kind of widgets.
  * 
  * This constructor can be called as a factory, without "new". Doing so allows passing an attributes
  * object which may include (in addition to the properties) children, event listeners and layout
  * shorthands.
