     * 1. The subscriptions are snapshotted just before every `dispatch()` call.

     * progress. However, the next `dispatch()` call, whether nested or not,
     * will use a more recent snapshot of the subscription list.
     *
     * 2. The listener should not expect to see all states changes, as the state
     * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
     * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
     * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest
     * state by the time it exits.
     *
     * @param listener A callback to be invoked on every dispatch.
     * @returns A function to remove this change listener.
