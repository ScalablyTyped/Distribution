    * with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
    * This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
    * has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
    *
    * Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
    * and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
    * If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
    * consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
    * If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
    * saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.

    * in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
    * re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
