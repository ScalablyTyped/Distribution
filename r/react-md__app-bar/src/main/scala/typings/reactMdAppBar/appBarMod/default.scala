/**
  * This component is used to create a top-level app bar in your application that
  * can be used to contain a navigation menu toggle button, the app's logo and/or
  * title, as well as any top-level actions that will be reused throughout your
  * app. When using this component with the `fixed` prop, it is recommended to
  * also use one of the "offset class names" so that your content will not be
  * converted by the app bar. You can also use any of the exposed mixins to add
  * these offsets as well.
