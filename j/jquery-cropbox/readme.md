# Scala.js typings for jquery-cropbox


## Library description:
jQuery plugin for in-place image cropping (zoom & pan, as opposed to select and drag).
 
 This plugin depends only on jQuery. If either `Hammer.js` or `jquery.hammer.js` is
 loaded, the cropbox plugin will support gestures for panning and zooming
 the cropbox. Similary, if the `jquery.mousewheel.js` plugin is loaded, then the
 cropbox plugin will support zoom in & out using the mousewheel. All
 dependencies on third party libraries (other than jQuery) are strictly
 optional. Support for CommonJS and AMD loading is built in.
 
 In browsers that support the HTML5 FIle API and Canvas API, the cropbox
 plugin provides mehtods to crop the image on the client and obtain the
 resulting cropped image as a Data URL or a binary blob to upload it to
 the server.
