/**
 * Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and character offset.
 * The offsets are based on a UTF-16 string representation. So a string of the form
 * `a𐐀b` the character offset of the character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀`
 * is 1 and the character offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code
 * units in UTF-16.
 *
 * Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position that
 * denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.
