/** 
 * Provides an easy way to get a listing of your tasks from your gulpfile. By default, the 
 * output groups tasks based on whether or not they contain a hyphen (-), underscore (_), 
 * or colon (:) in their name.
 * 
 * You can optionally override the Regexp used to determine whether a task is a primary or 
 * subtask, as well as filter out tasks you don't want to see in the output.
