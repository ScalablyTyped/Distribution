For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid\}`: An email address that represents a service account.

For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid\}?uid={uniqueid\}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.
