/**
  * A Camera Shake effect.
  * 
  * This effect will shake the camera viewport by a random amount, bounded by the specified intensity, each frame.
  * 
  * Only the camera viewport is moved. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their positions do
  * not change.
  * 
  * The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an `onUpdate` callback,
  * which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect if required.
