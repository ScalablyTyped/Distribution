/**
  * A Rope Game Object.
  * 
  * The Rope object is WebGL only and does not have a Canvas counterpart.
  * 
  * A Rope is a special kind of Game Object that has a texture that repeats along its entire length.
  * Unlike a Sprite, it isn't restricted to using just a quad and can have as many vertices as you define
  * when creating it. The vertices can be arranged in a horizontal or vertical strip and have their own
  * color and alpha values as well.
  * 
  * A Ropes origin is always 0.5 x 0.5 and cannot be changed.

    * @param texture The key of the Texture this Game Object will use to render with, as stored in the Texture Manager. If not given, `__DEFAULT` is used.
    * @param frame An optional frame from the Texture this Game Object is rendering with.
    * @param points An array containing the vertices data for this Rope, or a number that indicates how many segments to split the texture frame into. If none is provided a simple quad is created. See `setPoints` to set this post-creation. Default 2.
    * @param horizontal Should the vertices of this Rope be aligned horizontally (`true`), or vertically (`false`)? Default true.
    * @param colors An optional array containing the color data for this Rope. You should provide one color value per pair of vertices.
    * @param alphas An optional array containing the alpha data for this Rope. You should provide one alpha value per pair of vertices.
