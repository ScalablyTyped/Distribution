/**
  * The Curve Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
  * 
  * To render a Curve Shape you must first create a `Phaser.Curves.Curve` object, then pass it to
  * the Curve Shape in the constructor.
  * 
  * The Curve shape also has a `smoothness` property and corresponding `setSmoothness` method.
  * This allows you to control how smooth the shape renders in WebGL, by controlling the number of iterations
  * that take place during construction. Increase and decrease the default value for smoother, or more
  * jagged, shapes.
