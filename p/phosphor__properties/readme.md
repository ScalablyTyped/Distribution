## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * A class which attaches a value to an external object.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * Attached properties are used to extend the state of an object with
 * semantic data from an unrelated class. They also encapsulate value
 * creation, coercion, and notification.
 *
 * Because attached property values are stored in a hash table, which
 * in turn is stored in a WeakMap keyed on the owner object, there is
 * non-trivial storage overhead involved in their use. The pattern is
 * therefore best used for the storage of rare data.
