  * @description Name of event fired when a touch point is interrupted in some way.
  * The exact reasons for cancelling a touch can vary from device to device.
  * For example, a modal alert pops up during the interaction; the touch point leaves the document area;
  * or there are more touch points than the device supports, in which case the earliest touch point is canceled.
