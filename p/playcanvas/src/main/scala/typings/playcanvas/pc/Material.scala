/**
  * Create a new Material instance.
  * @property alphaTest - The alpha test reference value to control which fragments are written to the currently
  * active render target based on alpha value. All fragments with an alpha value of less than the alphaTest reference value
  * will be discarded. alphaTest defaults to 0 (all fragments pass).
  * @property alphaToCoverage - Enables or disables alpha to coverage (WebGL2 only). When enabled, and if hardware anti-aliasing is on,
  * limited order-independent transparency can be achieved. Quality depends on the number of MSAA samples of the current render target.
  * It can nicely soften edges of otherwise sharp alpha cutouts, but isn't recommended for large area semi-transparent surfaces.
  * Note, that you don't need to enable blending to make alpha to coverage work. It will work without it, just like alphaTest.
  * @property alphaWrite - If true, the alpha component of fragments generated by the shader of this material is written to
  * the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false, the alpha component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property blendType - Controls how primitives are blended when being written to the currently active render target.
  * Can be:
  *
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_SUBTRACTIVE}: Subtract the color of the source fragment from the destination fragment and write the result to the frame buffer.
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_ADDITIVE}: Add the color of the source fragment to the destination fragment and write the result to the frame buffer.
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_NORMAL}: Enable simple translucency for materials such as glass. This is equivalent to enabling a source blend mode of pc.BLENDMODE_SRC_ALPHA and a destination blend mode of pc.BLENDMODE_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA.
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_NONE}: Disable blending.
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_PREMULTIPLIED}: Similar to pc.BLEND_NORMAL expect the source fragment is assumed to have already been multiplied by the source alpha value.
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_MULTIPLICATIVE}: Multiply the color of the source fragment by the color of the destination fragment and write the result to the frame buffer.
  * * {@link pc.BLEND_ADDITIVEALPHA}: Same as pc.BLEND_ADDITIVE except the source RGB is multiplied by the source alpha.
  *
  * Defaults to pc.BLEND_NONE.
  * @property blueWrite - If true, the blue component of fragments generated by the shader of this material is written to
  * the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false, the blue component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property cull - Controls how triangles are culled based on their face direction with respect to the viewpoint.
  * Can be:
  *
  * * {@link pc.CULLFACE_NONE}: Do not cull triangles based on face direction.
  * * {@link pc.CULLFACE_BACK}: Cull the back faces of triangles (do not render triangles facing away from the view point).
  * * {@link pc.CULLFACE_FRONT}: Cull the front faces of triangles (do not render triangles facing towards the view point).
  * * {@link pc.CULLFACE_FRONTANDBACK}: Cull both front and back faces (triangles will not be rendered).
  *
  * Defaults to pc.CULLFACE_BACK.
  * @property depthTest - If true, fragments generated by the shader of this material are only written to the
  * current render target if they pass the depth test. If false, fragments generated by the shader of this material are
  * written to the current render target regardless of what is in the depth buffer. Defaults to true.
  * @property depthWrite - If true, fragments generated by the shader of this material write a depth value to
  * the depth buffer of the currently active render target. If false, no depth value is written. Defaults to true.
  * @property greenWrite - If true, the green component of fragments generated by the shader of this material is written to
  * the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false, the green component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property name - The name of the material.
  * @property redWrite - If true, the red component of fragments generated by the shader of this material is written to
  * the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false, the red component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property shader - The shader used by this material to render mesh instances (default is null).
  * @property stencilFront - Stencil parameters for front faces (default is null).
  * @property stencilBack - Stencil parameters for back faces (default is null).
  * @property depthBias - Offsets the output depth buffer value. Useful for decals to prevent z-fighting.
  * @property slopeDepthBias - Same as {@link pc.Material#depthBias}, but also depends on the slope of the triangle relative to the camera.
