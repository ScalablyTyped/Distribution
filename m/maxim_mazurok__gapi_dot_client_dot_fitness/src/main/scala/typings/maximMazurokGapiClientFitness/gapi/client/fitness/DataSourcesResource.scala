    * Creates a new data source that is unique across all data sources belonging to this user. A data source is a unique source of sensor data. Data sources can expose raw data coming
    * from hardware sensors on local or companion devices. They can also expose derived data, created by transforming or merging other data sources. Multiple data sources can exist for
    * the same data type. Every data point in every dataset inserted into or read from the Fitness API has an associated data source. Each data source produces a unique stream of dataset
    * updates, with a unique data source identifier. Not all changes to data source affect the data stream ID, so that data collected by updated versions of the same application/device
    * can still be considered to belong to the same data source. Data sources are identified using a string generated by the server, based on the contents of the source being created. The
    * dataStreamId field should not be set when invoking this method. It will be automatically generated by the server with the correct format. If a dataStreamId is set, it must match the
    * format that the server would generate. This format is a combination of some fields from the data source, and has a specific order. If it doesn't match, the request will fail with an
    * error. Specifying a DataType which is not a known type (beginning with "com.google.") will create a DataSource with a *custom data type*. Custom data types are only readable by the
    * application that created them. Custom data types are *deprecated*; use standard data types instead. In addition to the data source fields included in the data source ID, the
    * developer project number that is authenticated when creating the data source is included. This developer project number is obfuscated when read by any other developer reading public
    * data types.
