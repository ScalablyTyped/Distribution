/**
  * The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as
  * events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). While events are usually triggered by such "external" sources, they can also be
  * triggered programmatically, such as by calling the HTMLElement.click() method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a specified target using
  * EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and
  * methods which are common to all events.
