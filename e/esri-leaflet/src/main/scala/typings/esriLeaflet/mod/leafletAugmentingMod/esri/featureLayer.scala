    * `L.esri.FeatureLayer` is used to visualize, style, query and edit vector geographic data hosted in both
    * ArcGIS Online and published using ArcGIS Server. Copyright text from the service is added to map attribution
    * automatically.
    *
    * Feature Layers reference an individual data source in either a parent Map Service or Feature Service that can
    * contain multiple layers. You can see a sample Map Service URL below:
    * http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Hurricanes/MapServer
    *
    * This particular service includes two different data sources. The URL for the 'Hurricane Tracks' feature layer
    * will end in a number (representing its position among the other layers).
    * http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Hurricanes/MapServer/1
    *
    * Feature Layer URLs always end in a number (ex: /FeatureServer/{LAYER_ID} or /MapServer/{LAYER_ID}).
    *
    * You can create a new empty feature service with a single layer on the ArcGIS for Developers website or you
    * can use ArcGIS Online to create a Feature Service from a CSV or Shapefile
    *
    * L.esri.FeatureLayer divides the current map extent into a grid of individual cells and uses them to fire
    * queries to fetch nearby features. This technique is comparable to MODE_ONDEMAND in the ArcGIS API for
    * JavaScript.
