/**
 * Packs objects that have a width and a height into as small of a square as
 * possible, using a binary tree bin packing algorithm. After packing, each
 * object is given an (x, y) coordinate of where it would be optimally packed.
 * @param bins List of rectangular bins to pack
 * @param options Packing options.  Use inPlace: true to modify the bins
 *    argument in-place.
